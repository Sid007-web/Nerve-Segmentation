# Nerve-Segmentation
This project performs semantic segmentation of nerve structures in ultrasound images using a deep learning model based on the U-Net architecture. It aims to assist in accurate nerve localization for better pain management during surgical procedures.
## Features
- Upload grayscale ultrasound images (`.tif`, `.jpg`, `.png`) for segmentation.
- Displays the predicted nerve mask for each image.
- Built with a U-Net model trained on real ultrasound data.
- Evaluates predictions using Dice Coefficient and IoU.
- Visual interface using Streamlit.
